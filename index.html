  <h2>Classic Beige Tower PC</h2>
  This is a classic beige tower PC from the late 1990s to early 2000s, a symbol of the golden era of home computing. Featuring a CRT monitor with low-radiation branding, a bulky tower case with a 3.5-inch floppy drive, and a CD-RW drive labeled ‚Äú52x/32x/52x,‚Äù this setup was once the heart of countless homes, schools, and internet caf√©s. These machines typically ran on Windows 98 or Windows XP, powered by Intel Pentium III or early AMD processors. With their distinctive humming fans, beige plastic, and clunky mechanical keyboards, they offered a tactile computing experience that today feels almost analog. For many, this was the computer that introduced them to dial-up internet, LAN games like Counter-Strike, and the thrill of burning their first CD.</div>

  <h2>Lip-Shaped Landline phoneüíã</h2>
The lip-shaped landline phone is a quirky, retro-style novelty phone that adds a pop of personality to any room.

While it functions like a standard corded landline phone ‚Äî complete with dial pad, ringer, and receiver ‚Äî it‚Äôs primarily chosen for its bold aesthetic. Sound quality is decent for casual use, but it's best suited for vintage decor lovers or as a fun gift rather than daily business use.
